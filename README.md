## Hi, I'm Arnav ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

I am currently a third-year student at the University of California, Davis, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Technology Management and Italian. 

I view everyday as an opportunity to learn and grow, and I believe in using my skills to create a meaningful impact. Problem solving, and working on challenging tasks are things I enjoy.

I also enjoy getting involved on campus and trying new adventures and activities - I have been part of several organizations and clubs, held multiple leadership positions, been part of a student-startup, and I have also studied abroad!
